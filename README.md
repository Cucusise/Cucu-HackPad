# Cucu's HackPad Project

## 1. Introduction
This is my first project and it's a hackpad designed to enhance my skills, not only in design but also in manual dexterity.
It includes the electrical schematic, PCB layout, and the 3D printed case for assembly.

### Overview

## 2. Schematic Part
The electrical schematic was designed in KiCad and shows all connections between components.
Thanks to the tutorial I gained the knowledge to design this scheme.
It clearly illustrates how the microcontroller, switches, and other peripherals are connected.

## 3. PCB Layout Part
The PCB layout optimizes space and minimizes interference.  
It includes clean routing and logical component placement.

## 4. Case and Assembly part
The case is designed to fit the PCB and components perfectly.  
It ensures everything is protected and accessible for assembly.
